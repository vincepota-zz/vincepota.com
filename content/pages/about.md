Title: About

I am an Italian data scientist based in London. I help companies to unlock the full potential of their data using a broad spectrum of techniques. I have worked for [Acrotrend](https://acrotrend.com/) and [Capita](https://www.capita.com/). I am a big fan of python, nice looking visualizations and simple data models.

I have a PhD in astrophysics from Swinburne University in Melbourne. I was then a researcher at the University of California Santa Cruz and Naples Observatory before leaving academia for good and pursue a career in commercial
data science.
