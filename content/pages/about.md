Title: About

I am a Vice President data scientist working for Barclays Investment Bank in London. I work alongside equity analysts to incorporate alternative data into their investment thesis, and I publish research notes in the field of alternative data in finance.

I have a PhD in astrophysics from Swinburne University in Melbourne, followed by a research career at the University of California Santa Cruz and at Naples Observatory in Italy.

I left academia for good in 2015 to pursue a career in commercial data science. I am a big fan of python, nice looking visualisations and simple data models.
