Title: Publications

During my academic career I published five peer-reviewed papers as leading author. Here is a full list:

_Published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in August 2018_

2. __[The SLUGGS survey: multipopulation dynamical modelling of the elliptical galaxy NGC 1407 from stars and globular clusters.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2015MNRAS.450.3345P/PUB_HTML)__
_Published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in July 2015_

3. __[A SLUGGS and Gemini/GMOS combined study of the elliptical galaxy M60: wide-field photometry and kinematics of the globular cluster system.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2015MNRAS.450.1962P/PUB_HTML)__
_Published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in June 2015_

4. __[The SLUGGS survey: probing the supermassive black hole connection with bulges and haloes using red and blue globular cluster systems.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2013MNRAS.433..235P/PUB_HTML)__
_Published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in July 2013_

5. __[The SLUGGS Survey: kinematics for over 2500 globular clusters in 12 early-type galaxies.](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/428/1/389/1052149)__
_Published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in January 2013_

I also contributed to 27 peer-reviewed articles as co-author.
